# assignment3

I've accepted that this is the best version of this assignment that I am going to complete today.
I know it isn't perfect or necessarily a mirror of the q1 answers, but every answer seemed to make
intuitive sense to me. All of the basic debugging strategies you suggested turned up no major mistakes.
If there are any glaring flaws in my analysis, I'd love to know more about why those might be the case - in office hours, perhaps.
